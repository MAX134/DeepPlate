## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Detect license plates in real-time using YOLOv11.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieve accurate recognition with PaddleOCR.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.
- **Lightweight**: Efficient performance with low system requirements.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with various operating systems.
- **Database Integration**: Store recognized plates in SQLite for easy access and management.

## Technologies Used
This project leverages several powerful technologies:
- **Computer Vision**: cv2 for image processing.
- **Deep Learning**: YOLOv11 for object detection.
- **Image Recognition**: PaddleOCR for text extraction.
- **Database**: SQLite3 for data storage.
- **Libraries**: NumPy for numerical operations and Ultralytics for YOLO implementations.

## Installation
To set up DeepPlate on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MAX134/DeepPlate.git
   cd DeepPlate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the YOLOv11 Model**:
   Download the YOLOv11 model weights from the [Releases section](https://github.com/MAX134/DeepPlate/releases). Follow the instructions in the release to place the model in the appropriate directory.

## Usage
After setting up the project, you can use DeepPlate with the following command:
```bash
python main.py --input <path_to_video_or_image> --output <output_path>
```

Replace `<path_to_video_or_image>` with your source file and `<output_path>` with your desired output location.

## How It Works
DeepPlate uses a combination of YOLOv11 and PaddleOCR for effective license plate detection. The process can be broken down into these steps:

1. **Input**: Accepts either an image or a video stream.
2. **Detection**: YOLOv11 processes the input to identify potential license plate regions.
3. **Recognition**: PaddleOCR analyzes the detected regions to extract text.
4. **Output**: The results, including the detected license plates, are saved to the specified output.

## Examples
To illustrate how DeepPlate works, here are some example use cases:

### Example 1: Detecting from an Image
```bash
python main.py --input image.jpg --output result.jpg
```
This command will read `image.jpg`, detect any license plates, and save the results in `result.jpg`.

### Example 2: Processing a Video
```bash
python main.py --input video.mp4 --output output.mp4
```
This command processes a video file and outputs the processed video with recognized license plates.
